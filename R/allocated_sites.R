#' Allocated common sites
#'
#' The site information for Seaquest currently contains a lot of inaccurate
#' information but is being fixed by creating common site names. In the
#' meantime, sites have been manually aggregated where it looked like multiple
#' designations had been given for the same site. There common sites are
#' contained in the package for now, but will be unnessary in the future once
#' the database has been updated.
